Hi my name is Dave.  I am...

- a maker
- a gamer
- a motorcycle rider
- a scuba diver
- wearer of kilts (don't knock until you try it)
- and a software developer

As you can see my interests vary far and wide but they all keep me engaged in life and my mind sharp.

Now you found me here in GitHub so you are most interested in my software development skills.  Here goes.
I have been coding for over 8 years now.  My experience mainly focuses on backend C# .NET, but don't let
that fool you.  I have developed apps in VB.NET, Perl, SQL, Java, and Bash.  I have built web apps, thick
client app, and good old console apps.

My GitHub account is a collection of repos tracking some of my training modules as I learn all sorts of 
software processes.  You will find Angular app, Blazor apps, and just plain MVC web apps.  Some stuff is 
original and others are good old follow alongs but I did type it all out just so that I know how the
language works.

I am not always consistent in commiting my code to this GitHub account but I am always keeping my ear
to the ground, trying out new things and in the least reading the latest blogs and listening to the 
latest podcasts.

I hope that what you may see here might inspire you to look inquire to want to know me more.  If so,
shoot me a message.  I am always willing to talk to someone about my career or help someone out if they
need something.

Dave

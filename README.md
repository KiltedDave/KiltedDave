Hi my name is Dave.  I am...

- a maker
- a gamer
- a motorcycle rider
- a scuba diver
- wearer of kilts (don't knock until you try it)
- and a software developer

As you can see my interests vary far and wide but they all keep me engaged in life and my mind sharp.

Now you found me here in GitHub means you are most likely interested in my software development skills.  Here goes.
I have been coding for over 8 years now.  My experience mainly focuses on backend C# .NET, but don't let
that fool you.  I have developed apps in VB.NET, Perl, SQL, Java, and Bash.  I have built web apps, thick
client app, and good old console apps.  I even have database experience including both MS SQL Server and Oracle Server.

Let's just say that I am a man of many things but never a master of any, but that is okay.  I love to learn.

My GitHub account is a collection of repos tracking some of my training modules as I learn all sorts of 
software processes.  You will find Angular apps, Blazor apps, and even just plain MVC web apps.  Some stuff is 
original and others are just follow alongs but I always type it all out just so that I know how the
language works when I am chasing my typos.  :)

You may notice that I don't always keep this repo up-to-date but I am always keeping my ear to the ground, 
trying out new things and always reading the latest blogs and listening to the latest podcasts and Youtube series.  

Check out Soft Skills Radio podcast, IAmTimCory YouTube series, the ChangeLog podcasts, and the dotNET Weekly blog.

I hope that what see here might inspire you to inquire more about me and my work.  If so,
shoot me a message.  I am always willing to talk to someone about my career or even just help someone out if they
need something.

Take care and as a famous president once quipped, "Be excellent to each other and...PARTY ON DUDES!!!"

Dave
